# Next186 SoC PC

This is a  port of the [Next186 SoC](https://opencores.org/projects/next186_soc_pc) by (C) Nicolae Dumitrache.

Modifications from the original core:

- Added a standard MiST BIOS loader, the Next186.ROM will be loaded when the core starts.
- Selectable CPU speed (Maximum, half, third, quarter).
- CPU clock is 50 MHz, SDRAM clock is 100 MHz.
- DSP coprocessor is disabled currently (out of BRAM), MP3 playing is not possible.
- MPU 401 MIDI output.

## Usage

You'll need an installed MS-DOS (up to v6.22) on the SD-Card (or on a **Next186.VHD** file),
and the **Next186.ROM** BIOS file next to the **RBF**. 

There's a sample VHD "MIST & SIDI Next186 DOS VHD" on archive.org to get you started.

.RBF 、Next186.ROM and MIST & SIDI Next186 DOS VHD copy to SD, can load and start. 

The core requires firmware version at least **210715**.

This core has several compatibility issues (but slowly improving). Here's a spreadsheet with
hint and tips for some titles:

### Settings

- CPU Speed: Maximum, /2, /3, /4 - Normally it is OK to use Maximum but quite a few games work better when set to /3 
- MIDI: MPU401, COM1 - MPU401 enables the standard MIDI out port, COM1 enables COM1 serial rs232 out of the MIDI port.
- NMI: Hardware interrupt useful for debugging in DOS.

### VHD Support

You can mount a VHD file in Windows 10 using "Disk Management" > Attach VHD. You can then write files directly to the VHD as normal. Make sure file names are no more than 8 characters long.
To mount a VHD in MacOS use `hdiutil attach -imagekey diskimage-class=CRawDiskImage Next186.vhd`

### MIDI out

MPU 401 MIDI out is supported at the default 330 address. Interrupts are not support and not required for MIDI out. 

If you have no MIDI synth you can use MT32-Pi on a Raspberry Pi to play MIDI music for Roland MT-32 & General MIDI game support. If you have no MIDI input on the Raspberry Pi it is possible to connect MIDI out pins 2 (GND) & 5 (TX) to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins 6 & 10. MT32-Pi is configured out of the box to play through the GPIO. On a MIST without MIDI ports, or a SIDI, you can connect the GPIO to the serial port. DO NOT CONNECT ANY VOLTAGE LINES.

Some games may require a slower CPU /3 speed to work correctly with the MT-32 when sending sysex.

You can also control the MT32-Pi from DOS using [mt32-pi-control](https://github.com/gmcn42/mt32-pi-control/tree/main/dos_bin)
