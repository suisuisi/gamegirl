# Information about the SNES CPU Turbo option

This is a speedup hack to help reduce or eliminate the notorious slowdown often present in SNES games.

## WARNING

Use of the CPU Turbo function is outside the normal operation of SNES hardware. **Undesirable issues will occur if you use this feature in many games.** The following list of games is simply a reference of titles that are known to have slowdown in the SNES library, and how they react with this feature enabled.

## Ranking

All games are ranked by how well this feature can remove slowdown, along with whether any bugs are observed, and the severity of any bugs encountered. 

- **A** - Slowdown either completely removed or greatly reduced, with no apparent negative side effects
- **B** - Good speed improvements, but minor issues occur which keep the experience from being perfect
- **C** - Slight speed improvements at least. Games may have moderate issues that are not game breaking
- **D** - Improves performance but has severe issues and should not be used
- **E** - No improvement / Game-breaking issues

### Honorary Mentions

These are games that show a noticeable improvement from Turbo, though already have superior romhacks or SA-1 patches that do a better job of removing slowdown, generally with less stability concerns. These will be listed at the bottom of each rank.

The CPU Turbo option is not available when an SA-1 rom is loaded, in order to avoid likely conflicts.

# C

| Game   | Notes   | Playable to Ending Confirmed  |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| Chester Cheetah: Wild Wild Quest  | Improves slowdown slightly, but most still remains likely due to poor programming. |   |
| F-Zero  | *Very* minor slowdown reduction only noticeable when many cars are on-screen, while repeated collisions occur.   | X  |
| The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past  | Removes almost all slowdown. Triforce animation on title screen plays faster than normal. Map screen has a peculiar bug with controls that will change the button layout when it is opened. This also affects the Flute item when selecting where to land on the map. Workaround: Toggle turbo off while map is open, or experiment with buttons until you find correct ones.  |   |

# D

| Magic Sword  | Removes all slowdown from game. No sound unless Turbo is turned on *after* a stage has already started, and even then it cuts out at beginning of next stage unless it is turned off before previous stage ends. |   |
| Secret of Mana  | Helps with slowdown. Music throughout the game changes dramatically when Turbo is enabled, often very unpleasant.   |   |


# E

| Game   | Notes   | Playable to Ending Confirmed  |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| Contra III: The Alien Wars  | Will not load if Turbo is enabled. Can be used if you activate this after the game has already started, and does a great job of removing slowdown, especially at bosses. If a level ends while this is enabled, the game will freeze on a black screen. |   |
| DOOM  | No noticeable speed difference and sound effects break with Turbo enabled, yet music will continue to play.   |   |
| Top Gear 3000  | Will not load with Turbo enabled. If enabled after the game is loaded, will freeze to a black screen.  |   |
